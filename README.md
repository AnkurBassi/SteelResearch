> **Abstract. In this work, we have proposed a predictive model that can
> determine the hardness and phase fraction percentages of micro-alloyed
> steel with a predefined chemical composition during heat treatment
> under specific cooling conditions. The model uses a feed-forward
> neural network enhanced by the ensemble method. The model has been
> trained on experimental data derived from Continuous Cooling
> Transformation (CCT) diagrams for 39 unique steel types. The inputs to
> the model include a cooling profile defined by a set of
> time-temperature values, and the chemical composition of the steel.
> Sensitivity analysis was performed using the validated model to
> understand the impact of key input variables, including individual
> alloys and process steps. This analysis, which measures the
> variability in output in response to changes in a specific input
> variable, showed a significant correlation with experimental findings
> and literature reports. Thus, our model not only predicts steel
> properties under varied cooling conditions but also aligns with
> existing theoretical knowledge and experimental data.**
